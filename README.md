This Javascript app uses the Math.floor(Math.random()) function to generate a random target number between 19 and 120. And each crystal has a hidden value between 1-12. There are 4 crystals that will be displayed on the screen. Each round the user will receive a new target number. Each crystal will be assigned a new value. The user does not know the crsyal value until clicking on it. The goal for the user is to click on different crystals so that the sum adds up to the target number for that round.


<strong>Languages/Technologies Used</strong>


HTML, CSS, Javascript, Math.floor(), Math.random(), Bootstrap
